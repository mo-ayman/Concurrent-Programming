# OS Labs Solutions
This repository contains solutions for the labs in the Operating Systems course. Each lab has its own folder with a corresponding solution.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- Each lab or exercise has its own directory, named after the lab or exercise number.
- The solution files are also located within each directory ( .c file)
- A Bash script that you can use to both compile and run the solution. By executing this script, it will compile the necessary source code files and then 
run the resulting executable file to execute the solution

## Prerequisites
To run the solutions in this repository, you'll need:

- A Unix-like operating system
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- A text editor (e.g., Vim or Emacs)

## Technologies Used
The solutions in this repository are written in the following languages:

C: A general-purpose programming language used for system programming and low-level operations.
Bash: A Unix shell used for running scripts and automating tasks.
Labs
The following labs are included in this repository:

1. Simple Shell (Multi-Processing): Implementing a Unix shell program
2. Matrix Multiplication (Multi-Threading): Implementing a multithreaded matrix multiplication program
3. CalTrain (Synchronization and Mutual Exclusion): Implementing synchronization functions that will guarantee orderly loading of trains
## Usage
To use the solutions in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/mo-ayman/OS-Labs-Solutions.git
2. Change to the lab directory: cd Lab-X (where X is the lab number)
3. Simply run the script by executing ./shell.sh.
