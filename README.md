## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of solutions for multi-processing and multi-threading programming exercises encountered in the Operating Systems course. Each lab or exercise is organized within its own directory, providing a comprehensive set of solutions for various aspects of concurrent programming.

## Structure

The repository follows a structured organization:

- Each lab or exercise is represented by its own directory, labeled with the corresponding lab or exercise number.
- Solution files, typically written in C, are contained within each directory.
- A Bash script is provided for convenient compilation and execution of the solutions. Running the script compiles the necessary source code files and then executes the resulting executable to demonstrate the solution.

## Prerequisites

To utilize the solutions in this repository, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A Unix-like operating system
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- A text editor (e.g., Vim or Emacs)

## Technologies Used

The solutions leverage the following technologies:

- **C language:** A versatile programming language commonly used for system programming and low-level operations.
- **Bash:** A Unix shell utilized for running scripts and automating tasks.

## Applications

1. **Simple Shell (Multi-Processing):** Implementation of a Unix shell program.
2. **Matrix Multiplication (Multi-Threading):** Implementation of a multithreaded matrix multiplication program.
3. **CalTrain (Synchronization and Mutual Exclusion):** Implementation of synchronization functions ensuring the orderly loading of trains.

## Usage

To utilize the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mo-ayman/OS-Labs-Solutions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the lab directory: `cd LabX` (where X is the lab number).

3. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   ./shell.sh
   ```
